# Patient_Tracking_App

The goal of this project is to build a website with backend functionality. REST API calls are utilized to facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, so that information can be shared between them. The project uses React(TypeScript) for the frontend and Express for the backend.

This project is still in progress.

List of unfinished tasks:
1. Implement a SQL database in the backend
2. Add buttons and input to the frontend to make the backend functionality usable through the frontend.
3. Complete the API implementation.
